game boy frame boy

thing i pumped out lol

i dont think the DMG gameboy has enough power to do this on its own even with bankswitching

but the stuff you can do with modern software

requires pyboy and coded in python 3.7 but new python should work, however it was coded on windows so if anything breaks its probably a linux thing idk or mac if youre a weirdo

also requires numpy for literally one line of code (three actually)

requires dummy gameboy rom to run, i used the one from here https://github.com/assemblydigest/gameboy/tree/master/part-1-make-a-gb-rom/rgbds

the pyboy bootscreen will cause a wavy distortion in the first second or so

no audio support yet (id make a whole sequence format just for that lol, im the type to do that)

requires legally obtained copy of kemono friends episode 10 ncop (not supplied) (doesnt have to be kemono friends episode 10 ncop)
